## Abstract

Using the Gas Abstraction feature of [RIP-7560](./rip-7560.md) transaction multiple execution frames approach,
but applying the same approach to transactions authorized by being signed by an Externally Owned Account private keys,
we define extensions to existing EOA behaviour that are consistent with the current state of Account Abstraction debate.

## Motivation

The design work around Account Abstraction in Ethereum has started with
[EIP-86: Abstraction of transaction origin and signature](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-86)
back in 2017, however it there has recently been a lot of interest in implementing some sort of extension
to existing EOA functionality that can either be seen as a step towards "Full Native Account Abstraction",
or be evaluated on their own merit regardless of the eventual Account Abstraction design.

This proposal is intended to prevent the fragmentation and inconsistencies that may arise as a result of implementing
multiple independent standalone proposals by combining all of them into a unified design.

Here is the list of EIPs that propose adding features to EOA accounts that are addressed by this document:

* [EIP-2711: Sponsored, expiring and batch transactions](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2711)
* [EIP-3074: AUTH and AUTHCALL opcodes](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3074)
* [EIP-5003: Insert Code into EOAs with AUTHUSURP](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-5003)
* [EIP-5081: Expirable Transaction](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-5081)
* [EIP-5806: Delegate transaction](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-5806)
* [EIP-7377: Migration Transaction](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7377)

Each one of these proposals introduces features that can benefit both existing users and potential future users of
the Ethereum blockchain in multiple ways.

However, together these proposals consist 3 different transaction types and 3 opcodes, which is probably unsustainable.

None of these proposals supports Gas Abstraction that would be conceptually similar to "Paymasters" - smart contracts
capable of paying transaction gas, based on some on-chain validity function, but do not gain any
privileged access to sender's funds - despite this concept being widely used in production by
[ERC-4337: Account Abstraction Using Alt Mempool](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4337)
and even
[ERC-1613: Gas Stations Network](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1613)
before that.

None of these proposals fully support validity time ranges, which enable both scheduled and expiring transactions,
which adds a noticeable improvement to end-user experience with a relatively small amount of effort.

And most importantly none of these proposals forms a part of a bigger vision, instead being an isolated patch
that can be applied in a single design iteration. These proposals cannibalize each other's use-cases, but do not
fully resolve the pain points Ethereum users are currently suffering from, and do not fully align with the vision
of Full Native Account Abstraction.

## Specification

### Shared RIP-9999 transaction payload

The required synergy of the proposed transaction subtypes is achieved by defining a shared base structure of
a transaction. This will ensure the only differences between these subtypes are the strictly required
by their semantics instead of being implementation details.

```
  chainId,
  nonce,
  callData,
  paymasterData,
  paymasterGasLimit,
  maxPriorityFeePerGas,
  maxFeePerGas,
  validAfter,
  validUntil,
  accessList,
  yParity, r, s
```

### Gas-sponsored time-limited EOA transaction subtype

```
SPONSORED_EOA_SUBTYPE = x
```

This RIP-7560 transaction subtype allows ECDSA signature and nonce validation, same as the one used in all
of existing transaction types, to be applied to a transaction that can also provide `paymasterData`, `validAfter`
and `validUntil` parameters.

The transaction payload for this subtype is extended with the following fields:
```
 to
 value
 callGasLimit
```

This change extends the ability of an RIP-7560 transaction to include Paymaster data in order for the Paymaster
contract to accept the gas charges to all existing EOA accounts.
It also provided an EOA with an ability to explicitly specify a time range where this
transaction is valid, creating both "expiring" and "delayed" transactions.

In case the `to` field is `nil`, `callData` is treated as `initCode` for the purpose of contract creation,
enabling Gas Abstracted new smart contract deployment.



### Gas-sponsored time-limited batched execution EOA transaction subtype


```
BATCHED_EOA_SUBTYPE = x
```

This transaction subtype extends the `SPONSORED_EOA_SUBTYPE` transactions with an ability to initialize multiple
EOA calls with a single signature and a single Paymaster validation.


The transaction payload for this subtype is extended with the following fields:
```
 targets
 values
 gasLimits
 atomicity
```
The `targets` parameter is interpreted as an RPL encoding of `N` destination addressed.
The `values` parameter is interpreted as an RPL encoding of `N` 256-bit amounts.
The `callData` parameter is interpreted as an RPL encoding of `N` call data byte arrays.
The `gasLimits` parameter is interpreted as an RPL encoding of `N` 256-bit gas limit values.

The field `atomicity` contains an RLP encoded array of `N` elements of `byte` "atomicity" values.
Atomicity describes a behaviour in case of a top-level revert in one of the frames, and can take the following values:

* `CONTINUE_ON_REVERT = 0` - ignores the reverted execution and continues executing the batch
* `TERMINATE_ON_REVERT = 1` - stops the execution of the batch on the reverted execution, does not execute the remainder
* `ROLLBACK_ON_REVERT = 2` - rolls back all state changes caused by all the execution frames in current transaction

These parameters represent all the inputs necessary to perform `N` sub-transactions.


### Gas-sponsored time-limited one-time delegated EOA transaction subtype

```
DELEGATED_EOA_SUBTYPE = x
```

The transaction payload for this subtype is extended with the following fields:
```
 destination
 callGasLimit
```

This transaction subtype extends the `SPONSORED_EOA_SUBTYPE` transactions with an ability to execute arbitrary
contract code in the context of the EOA sender.

Note that such transaction provides a one-time signature delegating execution to the `destination` contract,
and this signature cannot be used repeatedly. The private key of the EOA will be needed to sign consequent delegations.

TODO: Opcode restrictions (SSTORE, CREATE, CREATE2)

### Gas-sponsored time-limited reusable authorization EOA transaction subtype

```
AUTHORIZED_EOA_SUBTYPE = x
```

The transaction payload for this subtype is extended with the following fields:
```
 chainId,
 nonce,
 invokerAddress,
 commit,
 callData,
 callGasLimit
```

This transaction subtype extends the `DELEGATED_EOA_SUBTYPE` transactions with an ability to authorize arbitrary
contract code to control the context of the EOA sender.

The transaction signature (`yParity`, `r`, `s`) are interpreted as an ECDSA signature on the `secp256k1` curve over
the message `keccak256(MAGIC || chainId || nonce || invokerAddress || commit)`.

Note that account's `nonce` is not incremented when `AUTHORIZED_EOA_SUBTYPE` transaction is executed so the same
authorization can be used unlimited number of times. In order to withdraw authorization, the account must perform
any action that will increment its nonce.

Transaction hash uniqueness is therefore not guaranteed by a nonce field, therefore must be explicitly be a requirement
for a transaction validity:

```
AUTHORIZED_EOA_SUBTYPE is not valid if a transaction with identical hash has alredy been included in the current chain
```

Note that most of the transaction fields are not signed by this transaction's signature. This means that the "invoker"
contract is the entity responsible for implementing all kinds of protections, and the EOA account that signs an
authorization fully cedes control to the "invoker" until the authorization is revoked.

For the purposes of Gas Abstraction, the `paymasterData` parameter is not signed as well,
so different Paymaster contracts can be used for subsequent authorized transactions using the same authorization.

[//]: # (TODO: we need to provide `commitment` bytes to the invoker for validation, this function is one way to do it)
We define the following Solidity structure to represent this transaction subtype on-chain:
```solidity
struct TransactionType4 {
    address invokerAddress;
    uint256 nonce;
    uint256 commit;

    uint256 paymasterGasLimit;
    uint256 callGasLimit;
    uint256 maxFeePerGas;
    uint256 maxPriorityFeePerGas;
    bytes paymasterData;
    bytes callData;
//    bytes signature; TODO rsv
}
```

We then define the following Solidity method and the `invokerAddress` of the transaction is invoked with the
corresponding data:

```solidity

    function executeAuthorizedTransaction(uint256 version, bytes32 txHash, bytes transaction) external;

```

#### Using permanent authorizations to create Smart Contract Accounts

This approach relies on the so-called "Nick's method", which includes deriving an address from some data and
a randomized signature value, without ever knowing the ECDSA private key that would be able to control this address.

Applying this approach to an `AUTHORIZED_EOA_SUBTYPE` transaction, a new account can be created,
whose address is forever bound to `invokerAddress` and `commit`, without ever needing to deploy code for the contract.


### Gas-sponsored time-limited code injection EOA transaction subtype

```
INSERT_CODE_EOA_SUBTYPE
```

This transaction subtype extends the `SPONSORED_EOA_SUBTYPE` transactions with an ability to insert
contract code in the context of the EOA sender.
