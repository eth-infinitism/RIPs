## Abstract

This proposal describes a slight variation of the Native Account Abstraction design fully described in RIP-7560.
This version's difference compared to the original proposal is in relying on features of "EVM Object Format" to
distinguish between validation and execution code sections.

## Motivation

Talking about Full Native Account Abstraction, the fundamental idea any solution has to address is a
mechanism for a Smart Contract Account to separate its validation and execution code sections.

The RIP-7560 is build on the current Ethereum contract structure, and therefore has little choice but to rely
on using some higher-level abstraction.

In its current form, RIP-7560 transactions use Solidity method selectors in order to achieve this separation.

This, however, is far from ideal as this approach "leaks" the concept from a programming language widely used
in the EVM into the core design of the Ethereum protocol.
While there is no purely technical reason to disallow it and there are already instances of Solidity code
being "enshrined" in the Ethereum protocol, e.g. the validator deposit contract, such violation of abstraction levels
often lead to unnecessary technical debt and are worth avoiding if possible.

As an alternative, if Native Account Abstraction is to be implemented in coordination with EIP-3540,
relying on the concept of "code sections" it introduces is a superior approach.

## Specification

### Validation and PostTransaction code sections

The EOF format describes a separation of 'code' and 'data' sections,
marked with `kind_code (0x02)` and `kind_data (0x04)` kind markers.

The contract that may have a role in an Account Abstraction transaction, either as a Sender, a Paymaster or a Deployer,
has to contain a section marked with the following kind marker:

```
kind_abstraction = 5
```

This section is equivalent to a code section.

Its code can be executed during a regular transaction execution and has no special effects.
If it is the first code section of a contract, it can act as an entry point during regular transaction execution.

Only a single section of `kind_abstraction` is allowed in a contract.
This rule is validated during contract creation.

### Execution entry point for Account Abstraction transaction type participant entity (Sender, Paymaster and Deployer)

During a regular contract code execution, its behaviour is defined as follows by EIP-3540:
```
Execution starts at the first byte of code section 0, and pc is set to 0
```

However, if a contract is referenced in an `AA_TX_TYPE` transaction as a Sender, Paymaster or a Deployer,
execution starts at the first byte of code section with `kind_abstraction` marker, and `pc` is set to 0.

If the specified contract does not contain such a section, or is not an EOF contract, the transaction is not valid.

### Encoding inputs for different execution frames

We define the following "action" identifiers:

```
sender_deployment = 1
sender_validation = 2
paymaster_validation = 3
paymaster_posttx = 4
```

#### Sender Deployment

Inputs to the `Deployer` contract are not defined by the protocol and are controlled by the `deployerData` parameter.

The sender deployment frame MUST result in the `sender` address becoming initialized with contract code.

#### Sender Validation

Inputs to the `Sender` validation section are defined by the protocol as a packed encoding of the following data:
```
uint256 action, uint256 version, bytes32 txHash, bytes transaction
```

The sender validation frame MUST return 32 bytes `validationData` that is interpreted as:

```solidity
abi.encodePacked(MAGIC_VALUE_SENDER, validUntil, validAfter)
```

#### Paymaster Validation

Inputs to the `Paymaster` validation section are defined by the protocol as a packed encoding of the following data:
```
uint256 action, uint256 version, bytes32 txHash, bytes transaction
```

The frame must return a bytes array that is interpreted as:

```solidity
abi.encode(context, MAGIC_VALUE_PAYMASTER, validUntil, validAfter)
```

#### Sender Execution
As the beginning of actual transaction execution, this call is made to the `Sender` contract directly,
meaning it will be executed starting at the first byte of code section 0, and `pc` set to 0.

Inputs to the `Sender` contract are not defined by the protocol and are controlled by the `callData` parameter.

#### Paymaster post-transaction frame

Inputs to the `Paymaster` post-transaction are defined by the protocol as a packed encoding of the following data:
```
uint256 action, bool success, uint256 actualGasCost, bytes context
```
